# Popular Movies, Stage 2
* Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Project
* Works with The Movie Database API

**IMPORTANT:** Reviewers should insert their API key.

### Project Summary

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, you’ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.
You’ll build the complete functionality of this app in two stages which you will submit separately.</p>

In this stage you’ll add additional functionality to the app you built in Stage 1.

You’ll add more information to your movie details view:

* You’ll allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
* You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
* You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). This is for a local movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request*.
* You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
